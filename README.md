# miscellaneous_abstractions

This repository contains various Pd abstractions I personally use, which might be helpful to others.
Most of them are vanilla, but some extended versions are included, whenever it's not possible to use a common abstraction both for vanilla and extended. All abstractions support both Pd versions this way.
